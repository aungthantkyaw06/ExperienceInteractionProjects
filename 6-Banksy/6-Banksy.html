					After researching the image on the left, I found that Northeastern had
					actually commissioned a French artist called Jef Aerosol to do the work.
					He has also done multiple stencils similar to that one around campus, and
					a quick Google search showed different works that he left at Northeastern.
					Jef Aerosol produced these works with spray paint and stencils. He is 
					quite popular within the urban art scene. With that being said, I believe
					that the work isnâ€™t by Banksy. However, one could argue that Jef Aerosol
					could be Banksy, since Banksy has never revealed his or her identity. We 
					can observe the similarity between their works and Jef Aerosol could be
					just another identity Banksy goes by.
